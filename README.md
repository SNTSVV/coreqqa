COREQQA - A COmpliance REQuirements Understanding using Question Answering Tool

## Description 
COREQQA is a tool for assisting requirements engineers in acquiring a better understanding of compliance requirements by means of automated Question Answering. Extracting compliance-related requirements by manually navigating through a legal document is both time-consuming and error-prone. COREQQA enables requirements engineers to pose questions in natural language about a compliance-related topic given some legal document, e.g., asking about data breach. The tool then automatically navigates through the legal document and returns to the requirements engineer a list of text passages containing the possible answers to the input question. For better readability, the tool also highlights the likely answers in these passages. The engineer can then use this output for specifying compliance requirements. COREQQA is developed using advanced large-scale language models from BERT’s family.
